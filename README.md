# ristek_pay

I have recently got the opportunity to be a part of Pekan Ristek 2024, a 2-week event held by Ristek Fasilkom UI. I joined as a Open Class Mentee hosted by the Mobile Development SIG. On this class we were taught how to develop a mobile application using Flutter. The application that we were developing as an assignment is called Ristek Pay. This is the repository for the assignment.
